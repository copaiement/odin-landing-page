# Basic Landing Page

## About
This is the code for a basic landing page using a flex layout. I will be using images and text to design a simple landing page for a clothing brand.
This project was made during the Foundations Course of the Odin Project.

## Goals
* Duplicate TOP layout from assignment
* Add unique images and text
* Use flex to format
* Use GitHub commits to track and upload changes

## Thoughts
Overall this was a pretty fun and enlightening assignment. The final page looks good and resizes appropriately when required.
Lessons learned:
* Images are finicky and require some thoughful placements and formatting to keep them from distorting or getting too small.
* Not everything needs to be flex. Some things are much easier to manipulate with standard formatting
* Coding a website from scratch (with multiple pages) could take a long time!
