# Basic Landing Page

## About
This is the code for a basic landing page using a flex layout. I will be using images and text to design a simple landing page for a clothing brand.
This project was made during the Foundations Course of the Odin Project.

## Goals
* Duplicate TOP layout from assignment
* Add unique images and text
* Use flex to format everything
* Use GitHub commits to track and upload changes
